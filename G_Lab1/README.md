# Programming Assignment 1

This assignment basically requires you to submit the Python client and server code for the UDP socket programming example in Section 2.7.1 and then also the TCP socket programming example in Section 2.7.2. You should each try to do this on your own first but you will then work with your assigned team for this assignment.

Split up your team to have one group do the UDP example together and another group to do the TCP example. 

## ASSIGNMENT GOAL

---

a) to learn about how UDP and TCP works and how to program with UDP and TCP and also

b) to make sure your computer is set up and working, ready for the next assignment where you will be writing your own code. You are welcome to use whatever IDE the team prefers

---

For this assignment with about 10 lines of code, you may prefer to simply use an editor but this is up to you. Code it, test it with the following cases:

- abcdef abc123def

- ABcdEF

- AB12cdEF

- Two Words HERE !!

The naming convention of the file should be

```
PA1_barbosa_halbert_reynolds_sedano.py
```

- **Put your names in the program as well**

- **Put in sufficient comments for you to understand what the code is doing and to clearly explain how your code works**

## **This assignment is worth 150 points.**
